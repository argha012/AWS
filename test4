To do assignment 3 (EC2 and EFS)- 1. Created an 3 ec2 instances in the any region with Ubuntu, Red Hat Linux and  Amazon Linux 2 then connect 3 created instances through the Gitbash.
                                     To create 3 instances go to AWS console-click on the instances- click on launch instance-give instances name-select Ubuntu, Red Hat Linux and Amazon Linux 2 as AMI for those instances-select existing key created key pair-select default security group then click on launch instance individually- Configure security group to allow SSH (port 22) and NFS (port 2049).
                                  2. Create an EFS File system open the AWS Management console then go to Amazon EFS service- Click on create file system give the name and select the VPC where instances are located then click on create file system.
 
                                  3. 4. Connect the created ec2 instances through Gitbash by using following commands:
                                    
                                          pwd
                                          ls -lrt
                                          cd Downloads
                                          ls
                                          ls -lrt key-file-name.pem
                                          chmod 400 key-file-name.pem
                                          ssh -i key-file-name.pem ubuntu@public ip of ubuntu-ec2 instance (For Ubuntu instance)

                                          pwd
                                          ls -lrt
                                          cd Downloads
                                          ls
                                          ls -lrt key-file-name.pem
                                          chmod 400 key-file-name.pem
                                          ssh -i key-file-name.pem ec2-user@public ip of red hat linux ec2 instance

                                          pwd
                                          ls -lrt
                                          cd Downloads
                                          ls
                                          ls -lrt key-file-name.pem
                                          chmod 400 key-file-name.pem
                                          ssh -i key-file-name.pem ec2-user@public ip of amazon linux 2 ec2 instance
                                      Then all the instances are connected 


                                  4. Connect the each instance to EFS- 
                                     Mount EFS on Ubuntu Instance by the following commands:
                                          sudo apt-get update
                                          df -h (To see the mount point)
                                          sudo apt-get install nfs-common
                                          sudo mkdir -p efs
                                          sudo mount -t nfs4 ip of EFS:/ efs
                                          nfsstat -m (To see the updated mount)
                                          df -h (EFS mounting is completed)
                
                                    Mount EFS on Red Hat Linux Instance by the following commands:
                                          sudo yum install -y nfs-utils
                                          df -h (To see the mount point)
                                          sudo mkdir -p efs
                                          sudo munt -t nfs4 IP of EFS:/ efs
                                          df -h (EFS mounting is completed)
             
                                    Mount EFS on Amazon Linux 2 Instance by using following commands:
                                          sudo yum install -y nfs-utils
                                          df -h (To see the mount point)
                                          sudo mkdir -p efs
                                          sudo munt -t nfs4 IP of EFS:/ efs
                                          df -h (EFS mounting is completed)
